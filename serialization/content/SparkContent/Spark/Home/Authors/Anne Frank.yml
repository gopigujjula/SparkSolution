        <span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #333333;">Anne Frank was a teen diarist and writer who transformed the pain of her secret world into a memoir that would be the most enduring document of the Nazi occupation in Germany. She was a German-Jewish teenager who, with her family, was forced to go into hiding. Her wartime diary, the Diary of a Young Girl, has been adapted into several plays and films since its publication in 1947.</span>
